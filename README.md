*256x256 plains with 1100 beavers. FPS Low increases from ~6 to 12+*

Timberborn really starts to struggle with a lot of beavers, it becomes very stuttery, drops inputs, and becomes effectively unplayable.
This mod attempts to fix the stuttering, allowing you to build large colonies of thousands of beavers.

# Warning
This mod is *not well tested* and may cause problems, such as farmers not properly harvesting or planting crops. You must **BACK UP YOUR SAVE** before installing this mod!

Also, it's impact is at present limited to mainly boosting minimum FPS, rather than overall.  It's still helpful to improve the "smoothness" of the game but not going to be a game changer until more work is done.  We are looking at new optimizations actively.

If you choose install this, please reach out to me (@R-T-B) on discord or in the modding channel on the [official Timberborn discord](https://discord.com/invite/timberborn). If it's working well, or if you find issues, I'd really appreciate hearing about your experiences!
