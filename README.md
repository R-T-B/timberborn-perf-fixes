*256x256 plains with 1100 beavers. FPS Low increases from ~6 to 12+*

Timberborn really starts to struggle with a lot of beavers, it becomes very stuttery, drops inputs, and becomes effectively unplayable.
This mod attempts to fix the stuttering, allowing you to build large colonies of thousands of beavers.
